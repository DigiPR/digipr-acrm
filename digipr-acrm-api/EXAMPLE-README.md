## Analysis

### Scenario

A-CRM (Agency Customer-Relationship-Management) is the smallest possible and lightweight demonstration tool that allows agents to manage their customer data. Agents have an own access to their customer data.

### Use Case
![](images/A-CRM-Use-Case.png)
- UC-1 [Login on A-CRM]: Agents can log-in by entering an email address and password. As an extension, new agents my register first.
- UC-2 [Register on A-CRM]: Agents can register to get an account (profile) to access the A-CRM system.
- UC-3 [Edit a customer]: Agents can create, update and delete customers.
- UC-4 [Show a customer list]: Agents can get an overview over their customers based on a customer list. As an extension they can create, update and delete customers (UC-3).

## Design

### Endpoint Prototype
**Path**: [`/api/customer`](/api/customer) 

**Method:** `POST`

**Sample Request**  • *Header:* `Content-Type: application/json` • *Body:*

```JSON
{
  "agent": {
    "customers": [
      null
    ],
    "email": "string",
    "id": 0,
    "name": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "remember": "string"
  },
  "email": "string",
  "id": 0,
  "mobile": "string",
  "name": "string"
}
```

• *Optional:* `...`
  
**Success Response**  • *Code:* `200 OK` • *Sample Body:*

```JSON
{
  "agent": {
    "customers": [
      null
    ],
    "email": "string",
    "id": 0,
    "name": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "remember": "string"
  },
  "email": "string",
  "id": 0,
  "mobile": "string",
  "name": "string"
}
```

**Error Response** • *Code:* `404 NOT FOUND`

### Data Access / Persistence Layer

The `rocks.process.acrm.data.domain` package contains the following domain objects / entities including getters and setters:

### Business Layer

The `rocks.process.acrm.business.service` package contains classes of the following business services:

### Service Layer / API

On the service layer, the API for customer management has been realised using the REST style as it can be seen using the Swagger-UI.

## Deployment

This spring boot application can be deployed to Heroku by adding the following `Procfile` to the project root:
```console
web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar /target/*.jar
```

Finally the Swagger-UI can be access using the Heroku app specific address such as: `https://***.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html`
